Project 1 Writeup 

Your first project is to be 
100 lines for CIS 5
250 lines for CIS 17A,18A
750 lines for CIS 17C,18B
which must include
concepts from Lessons completed prior to the date it is due.
The key is to include as many concepts from the 
Chapters in the book covered up to the due date.

The on-line class should submit in the assignment section as well
as sending to my email address, mark.lehr@rcc.edu

I have included several example writeups from various classes
for your review.


The writeup should have the following sections

Introduction
   Answer, what it is, why you are doing it, why it is important
   If your Mom can read this and understand it then your introduction
   should be pretty good.
Summary
   Give me statistics on how large the program is, why it meets the
   criteria for a first project.  How many variables, constructs,
   utilized etc....  Was it challenging to do, how long did it take
   you and anything else you can say especially aspects of the
   project that you had to construct from other chapters not
   directly covered in this course which you can bring up as extra
   credit.
Description
   Initially, describe in general terms how you programmed the 
       solution to the problem.  Include
   Sample Input/Output
	Give me inputs to use and what the outputs would be.  Screen
        shots are a must.
   Flowcharts/Pseudocode/UML
        Document visually enough of the code so that I know you
        can use the visual techniques required.
   Variables
        Describe all major variables, their types and where located
        in the code.
   Concepts
        Each chapter you learned new concepts, syntax and keywords.  List
        them and tell me where they located in the program.
References
   Describe pieces of code borrowed from elsewhere or other code
   you had to convert, etc...
Program
   Listing of your documented code.
