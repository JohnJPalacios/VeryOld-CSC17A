From this distant vantage point, the Earth might not seem of any particular interest. But for us, it's different. Consider again that dot. That's here. That's home. That's us. On it everyone you love, everyone you know, everyone you ever herd of, every human being who ever was, lived out thier lives there. the aggregate of our joy and suffering, thousands of confident religions, ideologies, and economic doctrines, ever hunter forager, every hero and coward, every creator and destroyer of civilization, every king and peasant, every young couple in love, every mother and father, hopeful child, inventor and explorer, every teacher of morals, every corrupt politician, every "superstar," every "supreme leader," every saint and sinner in the history of our species lived there -on a mote of dust suspended in a sunbeam. -carl Sagan, Pale blue dot.
